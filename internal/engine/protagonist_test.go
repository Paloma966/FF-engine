  I'll find something he cannot explain away.

  The dust motes floating in the attic light as I held the envelope. The way
  my father's handwriting looked exactly as I remembered it — familiar and
  suddenly alien at the same time.

  He lied to me. My whole life, he lied. But why? What was so terrible that
  he couldn't tell his own son? And why do I feel like I'm standing at the
  edge of something much bigger than a missing father?
