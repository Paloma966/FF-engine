  The story has just begun. The protagonist Lin En lives in a border village
  under the shadow of the Empire's war. Tensions are low but the world is
  unsettled. This is the inciting moment.

thread_inventory: []

arc_status: |
  Lin En is at the beginning of the "discovery" arc. He believes his life
  is ordinary and his father's disappearance was a simple accident.
  This belief needs to be challenged.

tension_calibration: |
  Starting from zero. The opening should establish atmosphere and introduce
  the central mystery. Recommend: moderate tension (4-5) to hook the reader
  without overwhelming them.

  description: "Lin En climbs into the attic to store winter blankets. Behind a loose floorboard, he discovers a sealed envelope bearing his father's handwriting. The letter is dated the day before his father disappeared — but his father supposedly left on a routine trading trip with no warning. The letter's seal is unbroken, meaning it was never sent. When Lin En opens it, the first line reads: 'If you are reading this, I am already gone — and what I told you about the Empire was a lie.'"
